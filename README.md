# PHP-CI-SDM-Group2

This is a web-based forum management software written in PHP (MySQL) with CodeIgniter.
Implementing functions like Single sign on, push/mail notifications, subscribing topics and authors,
and basic forum services including user profile, posting and comment.
This was specifically written for a department and was a course project.

#Usage

* Create a database using the SQL dump provided. The dump provided has some sample data in it. Use them to explore the system. You can empty them after installation as well. Also make sure to add a user while importing the dump.
* Update ./application/config/database.php to the correct host, DB name, user and password. You might also have to update the table prefix if you've changed them in the database.
* Because the single sign on feature, user can try ac="R02725020",pw="xu3jo6vmp6", and remove registering function.
